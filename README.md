# rhoReactingCentralFoam
An OpenFOAM solver that combines rhoCentralFoam and rhoReactingFoam for high-speed reactive flows. Tested extensively for ability to model detonations. 

This solver was originally created by Caelan Lapointe at the University of Colorado Boulder, and was developed for the Foundation version of OpenFOAM, OpenFOAM 7.

**Detonation with adaptive meshing:**

## Example Usage
Ensure you are running OpenFOAM 7. Look in the example directory for an example of a detonation being modeled, with adaptive meshing (AMR), adaptive time stepping tracking both central and acoustic time stepping (see `controlDict`), and parallelized with MPI. 

Additionally, an [MS Aerospace engineering thesis](https://github.com/duncanam/thesis) with example detonation runs for static and adaptive meshing can be found [here.](https://github.com/duncanam/thesis/tree/master/sim/analysis)

## Notes

Feel free to create pull requests with questions or concerns. While I am not the primary author, I have rigorously tested this solver for detonation modeling for my master's degree work. I may be able to assist with usage or point you towards someone who can help.
